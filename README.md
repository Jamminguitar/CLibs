## Ropes
The Ropes library implements the ropes data structure in a manner similar to AVLs, but with the added complexity of storing up to 8 bytes of string data in each leaf node. This library is *in development*.
The primary purpose of this library is to assist with creating a command-line text editor using only C code, with the hope that it will eventually be able to run on HegterOS.
